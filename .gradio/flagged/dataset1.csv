I would suggest trying topical creams or gels containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to help reduce bacteria and inflammation, and oral antibiotics may be necessary if the condition is severe, additionally maintaining good skincare habits such as keeping the face clean and avoiding picking or popping pimples can also help alleviate the condition.",,2025-07-12 09:32:45.858805
